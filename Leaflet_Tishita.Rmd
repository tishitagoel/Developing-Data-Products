Creating a leaflet map object.
```{r cars}
library(leaflet)
```


Then we create the pop-up map of NCR, which would be interactive.
```{r}
NCR <- c("<a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safdarjung_(Delhi)' >Safdarjung in Delhi</a>")
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=28.5647, lng=77.1949, popup = NCR)
```
